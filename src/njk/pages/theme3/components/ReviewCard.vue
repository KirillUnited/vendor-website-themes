        My fiancé and I had an absolutely wonderful time having our engagement
        photos taken with Mr. Hawk. He was kind, generous with his time and knew
        exactly how to pose us to get the most flattering shots. We were able to
        examine many of the shots after he took them during the session and
        given the option to retake any particular shot if we didn’t like
        positioning. Photos came back in a timely manner and are absolutely
        beautiful. The editing was done so well the images almost floated off
        the page. I would recommend Hawk Photography to anyone looking for a
        professional, knowledgeable and generous... My fiancé and I had an
